            <p> Hello and how are you? Shiva has an association with Venus or Shukra, which few know about, which he has the power to control, as Venus appears either as a morning or evening star not far from the Sun, which absorbs it back into himself.
                <br> Solar Shiva and Venus relate to ecstasy, transformation, death and rebirth.
                <br>
                As the lord of the serpents or transformative/lightning energies in the universe (Ahipati, Nageshvara), Shiva rules over Rahu and Ketu, the two lunar nodes, and the dramatic eclipses they are associated with. 
                <br> Shiva can drink poison and not be affected by it.
                <br>
                Rahu’s negative astral energies that disturb the mind and make us psychically vulnerable are nothing to him, for whom the mind is but a shadow.
                <br> Ketu in particular indicates Moksha, liberation of consciousness granted by Shiva. 
                <br>It also indicates his third eye.
                Shiva is associated with a number of Nakshatras, which is a significant study in its own right that I will detail elsewhere. 
                <br> Most important are Mrigashiras (23 20 Taurus – 06 40 Gemini), which is Shiva’s Soma form, and Ardra (06 40 – 20 00 Gemini), which is his Rudra form. 
                <br>These mark the region of Orion, which overall relates to Shiva as the deity of death and immortality, and the Gemini point opposite the Galactic Center in Sagittarius. Nearby Krittika (26 40 Aries – 10 00 Taurus), the Pleiades, as ruled by Agni connects to Shiva’s fire energy as well. </p>
